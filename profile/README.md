## More About Us

My name is Treasure Alekhojie I'm a 17yrs old Full Stack Web Developer and an App Developer, I founded the company AppJoli by a certain problem I had. I always find it difficult coming up with a project idea and how to go about it, then oneday I realised programming is really problem solving so I tried to tackle a certain problem within my community, which certainly didn't work at first, but I tried and tried until I figured out one key note, and that is just build something out of your daily life, for example a TodoApp or an automated mailing system, stuff like that and I kept building and building until everything came to place. But that was it after I have known this key system what's next, I can't ask people all around what's your issue/problem so I got back home and start dream coding, that means code what comes to my head, which seems funny at first. But I had this idea of cloning apps and making it better, I cloned Facebook, WhatsApp, Google. But made it my own not noticable to anyone that this a a copy. Then I tried all this concept and put them together to build this sucessful business which you know as *App Joli* today
